Find all of the anagrams in a dictionary in which there are at least 4 letters in the word and at least as many anagrams as there are letters.

**testwords.txt** is a test file, fairly short in length. 

**words.txt** is the full dictionary file, copied from */usr/share/dict/words* on my macbook.

To run, copy at least **words.txt** and **anagram.py** to the same folder locally. 
Then run the following in the terminal:

`python anagram.py`
